/**
 * LOOPS:
 * 
 * 0. Loops in JavaScript are used in cases where you have to repeat some action several
 * times to elements in a collection or string. There are a few of these loops and each
 * is dedicated to a certain datatype as well as has a specific syntax. Loops are a way 
 * to tackle the D.R.Y. method: Don't Repeat Yourself.
 * 
 * 1. for loops are used to iterate through arrays and also strings (using the length
 * property during the iterative statements). for loops have 3 statements used to iterate
 * over the collection: (1) expression for the starting point, (2) expression for the 
 * ending point, (3) statement indicating the increment, which uses the increment operator (++)
 * or the decrement operator (--) when looping in reverse. The syntax begins with the 
 * keyword "for" and then parentheses. The 3 statements are put inside these parentheses separated
 * by a semicolon. Next comes a pair of curly brackets which ultimately closes the loop. Inside
 * of these brackets is where you want to put the action you want repeated to each element
 * across the collection throughout the loop. Once outside of the loop, it will end and return
 * whatever value or outcome you programmed it to give. for loops can iterate forwards or backwards.
