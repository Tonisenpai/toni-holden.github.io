/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 0. What are variables? Variables can be thought of as containers that hold values.
 * They are empty until you fill them with something. They can exist without being
 * tied to a value, but if you try to call it later, the value will return "undefined".
 * These variables are later used in statements, expressions and functions.
 * 1. For a variable to exist, they must first be declared. The declaration of a 
 * functionis how your code knows of the existence of your variable. There is a specific
 * syntax used to declare a variable. To begin, you must use one of three keywords:
 * "var", "let", or "const". Next, you must name the variable (using camelCase). To
 * complete your declaration, you end your expression with a semicolon.
 * 2. To add a value to a variable 
 * 3.
