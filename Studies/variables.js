/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 0. What are variables? Variables can be thought of as containers that hold values.
 * They are empty until you fill them with something. They can exist without being
 * tied to a value, but if you try to call it later, the value will return "undefined".
 * These variables are later used in statements, expressions and functions.
 * 1. For a variable to exist, they must first be declared. The declaration of a 
 * function is how your code knows of the existence of your variable. There is a specific
 * syntax used to declare a variable. To begin, you must use one of three keywords:
 * "var", "let", or "const". Next, you must name the variable (using camelCase). To
 * complete your declaration, you end your expression with a semicolon.
 * 2. To add a value to a variable, it must be "assigned" to the variable. Assignment is 
 * done by using what is called an assignment operator (=). Variables can also be 
 * "initialized" during declaration. A variable being initialized just means that it is
 * declared and assigned all in one line of code. This is recommended for most situations.  
 * 3. Variables can also be re-assigned, under normal circumstances (within its own scope). 
 * There are some instances where this is not the case, but basically, they can be 
 * re-assigned when using the "var" keyword. In cases where the keywords "let" and "const"
 * are concerned, this is where you'll run into some issues with re-assignment. This has
 * a lot to do with the concept mentioned above called "scope". Once assigned, variables
 * assigned or initialized with the keyword "const" cannot be re-assigned throughout the 
 * life of your program. Let variables are block/function scoped, which means that they
 * cannot be accessed outside of the function it was declared in.
