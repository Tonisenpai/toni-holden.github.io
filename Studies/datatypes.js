/**
* DATATYPES:

* 0. There are several different types of data in JavaScript that exist all throughout
your code. These types of data are typically the values that are assigned to variables. 
Datatypes range from simple (also called "primitive") to complex and these distinctions
are important to take note of, because JavaScript looks at each of them differently. 
There are more things you can do with complex datatypes than you can with primitive ones.

* 1. Number: a number variable is a value representing a digit or set of digits, either
a whole integer or a decimal value. The number variable can be copied by value, as it is a
simple datatype and can be used in simple calculative functions as well as be placed as a
value inside of a complex datatype.
 
* 2. String: a string variable represents a string of text. This text can be anything you
type on a keyboard onto the screen, and it includes spaces as well. A string is indicated 
by single or double quotation marks located at the front and back of the string. Even 
though strings are said to be simple datatypes, JavaScript sees them as objects 
(a complex datatype) in the background. Because of this, strings have methods one can use
to manipulate strings you pass through the methods as values (see 'string manipulation page').
Still, strings are copied by value instead of by reference, despite being viewed as objects. 
Strings can also be used in the looping process (see 'string manipulation page'). 

* 3. Boolean: a boolean value results in either "true" or "false". Because of this, the 
words "true" and "false" are reserved keywords that cannot be mishandled if you don't want
errors in your code. Boolean values are typically seen either as values in a complex datatype 
or as a returned value in functions and conditional statements.

* 4. Array: an array is a complex datatype. Because of this, an array can hold simple and
complex datatypes inside of it as values. This is what makes it complex. An array is also
known as a collection, or an ordered list and is ordered by index. Arrays begin their index
count at 0, the second index at 1 and so on; and the last element in the array is always 
indicated or accessed using "array.length - 1". Due to the unique way the indices are 
counted, the number of indices will always be one less than it's actual length. There are
many methods that can be used to manipulate values in an array. Arrays are also used a lot 
during the looping process in order to manipulate each value in the array during each iteration
instead of hard-coding the change to each value yourself using access by bracket notation 
(see 'loops' page). 

* 5. Object: an object is an unordered list of elements and is viewed as a complex datatype
and a collection just like arrays.

* 6. Function:

* 7. undefined:

* 8. null: 

* 9. NaN: 

* 10. Infinity and -Infinity: 

* 11. 

* 12.
