/**
* OPERATORS:
 
* 0. Operators in JavaScript are used to make certain calculations or comparisons in functions 
and statements. These operators act on all datatypes and for many different operations. In JavaScript, 
there are seven different types of operators that can be used to manipulate values in some way.
 
* 1. Assignment Operators: Assignment Operators: assignment operators are used in the assignment of values 
to variables. The typical assignment operator, symbolized by the equal sign (=) assigns the value on the right 
side of the symbol to the variable declared on the left side of the symbol. The "add and assign" operator is 
symbolized by the plus and equal sign (+=), which adds the value on the right side to the variable to the left 
side, and then assigns that new (added) value to the variable all at the same time. The "subtract and assign" 
operator, symbolized by the minus and equal sign (-=), does much the same as the "add and assign" operator, except 
it uses subtraction instead of addition. The "multiply and assign" operator does the same, but with multiplication 
and is symbolized by an asterisk and equal sign (*=), and "divide and assign" uses division with the same kind of 
application, symbolized with a backslash and equal sign (/=).   
  
* 2. Comparison Operators:
 
* 3. Arithmetic Operators:
  
* 4. Logical Operators:
 
* 5. String Operators:

* 6. Unary Operators:

* 7. Conditional or Ternary Operators:
